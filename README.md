# Project 1 

Put your README here. Answer the following questions.

## * What does the model you have implemented do and when should it be used?
  
Ans :-

In this project, we implemented Linear Regression with ElasticNet Regularization. The ElasticNet model is a combination of L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques, which helps in preventing overfitting and feature selection in regression problems. The model solves the linear regression problem by minimizing the loss function, while applying both types of regularization to the coefficients. The L1 regularization encourages sparsity, meaning it drives some coefficients to zero, which can be useful for feature selection. On the other hand, L2 regularization discourages large coefficients, helping to handle multicollinearity and preventing overfitting.

### ElasticNet is particularly useful when:

There are many correlated features in the dataset.
You want to perform both feature selection (via L1) and shrinkage (via L2).
You need a balance between the strengths of Lasso (feature selection) and Ridge (stability) regularization.




## * How did you test your model to determine if it is working reasonably correctly?

Ans :-

To evaluate the correctness of our implementation, we employed k-fold cross-validation (5 folds). This method splits the dataset into multiple folds, where the model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process repeats for each fold, ensuring that the model is trained and tested on different subsets of the data. Using cross-validation helps ensure that the model generalizes well and isn't overfitting to one particular train-test split. We measured the performance of the model using two key metrics :-

•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): Indicates the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.

•	R-squared (R²): Measures how well the model explains the variance in the data.

We also visualized the results by plotting actual vs predicted values and residual histograms to assess model performance visually. The consistent R-squared values across different folds showed that the model was performing well.




## * What parameters have you exposed to users of your implementation in order to tune performance? (Also perhaps provide some basic usage examples.)

Ans :- 

### We exposed several parameters to allow users to tune the performance of the ElasticNet model:

• alpha: Controls the strength of the regularization. Higher values result in stronger regularization, making the model more conservative in selecting features.

• l1_ratio: Determines the mix between L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization. A value closer to 1 emphasizes L1 (more feature selection), while a value closer to 0 emphasizes L2 (more coefficient shrinkage).

• max_iter: Defines the maximum number of iterations for the optimization process.

• tol: Sets the tolerance for determining when the optimization process has converged, providing control over the trade-off between accuracy and computation time.

These parameters allow users to customize the regularization behavior and optimize the model for different datasets or use cases.




## * Are there specific inputs that your implementation has trouble with? Given more time, could you work around these or is it fundamental?

Ans :- 

Our implementation may face challenges with datasets that exhibit extreme non-linearity or contain a large number of outliers. Since ElasticNet is fundamentally a linear model, it may struggle to fit datasets with strong non-linear relationships. Additionally, sparse datasets or datasets with many missing values might not be handled effectively, as the model assumes complete and well-behaved data.

### Given more time, we could work around these issues by:

• Introducing non-linear transformations or polynomial features to extend the model's ability to handle non-linear relationships.

• Developing a preprocessing pipeline that handles missing values, outliers, and scaling issues before feeding the data into the model.

However, some of these challenges are inherent to linear models, and addressing them fully might require using more advanced techniques, such as non-linear models (e.g., decision trees or neural networks) or robust outlier detection mechanisms.
